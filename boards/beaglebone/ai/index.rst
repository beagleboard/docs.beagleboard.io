BeagleBone AI
###############

BeagleBone AI is based on the Texas Instruments `AM5729 <https://www.ti.com/product/AM5729>`_ dual-core 
Cortex-A15 SoC with flexible BeagleBone Black header and mechanical compatibility. BeagleBone AI makes 
it easy to explore how artificial intelligence (AI) can be used in everyday life via the TI C66x 
digital-signal-processor (DSP) cores and embedded-vision-engine (EVE) cores supported through an 
optimized TIDL machine learning OpenCL API with pre-installed tools. Focused on everyday 
automation in industrial, commercial and home applications.
