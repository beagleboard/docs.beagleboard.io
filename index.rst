Boards
******

This is where you will find the System Reference Manuals (SRMs) for all of the boards.

All Beagles are `open-hardware <https://www.oshwa.org/definition/>`__ with documentation on the
design, including the
`materials <https://git.beagleboard.org/explore/projects/topics/boards>`__ to modify the designs
from source using appropriate design tools.
